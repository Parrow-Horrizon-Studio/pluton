"""The C++ kernel's Face::normal and Scene.face_normal must agree — sign included.

Issue #110, kernel half. Two independent implementations of the same quantity
now exist: `Scene.face_normal` in Python (Newell's method over the whole loop,
`_newell_normal` in python/pluton/scene/scene.py) and `Face::normal` in the
C++ kernel, read back through `face_triangle_buffer`. Cross-checking them
against each other is the strongest guard available, because it is the exact
check that would have caught the reopened bug: the kernel used to estimate the
normal from the loop's first three vertices and substitute a hardcoded
`(0, 0, 1)` when they were collinear, while Python computed the real one.

Why the kernel's copy is the one that shows: the renderer reads it out of
`face_triangle_buffer` for lighting, and since M7.5b `_face_uv_geometry` in
python/pluton/viewport/scene_renderer.py reads the very same block to build
each face's TEXTURE PROJECTION BASIS. A wall answering `(0, 0, 1)` is textured
as a floor.

Every case here is duplicated in a COLLINEAR-START form — the same face with
its first edge split, which is what an edge split leaves behind and which is
the shape that defeated the old estimate. The Python-side regression test for
this issue put its face in the XY plane, where the `(0, 0, 1)` fallback is
accidentally the right answer, and so missed the kernel half entirely; the
vertical and oblique cases below are where the two diverge.
