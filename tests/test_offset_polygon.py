    Deliberately a different algorithm from the implementation's own

    sign comparison): this solves ``p1 + t*(p2-p1) == p3 + u*(p4-p3)`` for
    the two segment parameters ``t`` and ``u`` directly and reports a
    crossing when both lie in ``[0, 1]`` (within `tol`). Using a genuinely
    different method -- rather than the same sign-comparison idea reapplied
    -- means this test can catch a bug in that shared idea, not only a bug
    in how the implementation applies it.

    Near-parallel segments (the 2x2 system's determinant is close to zero)
    are handled explicitly rather than falling through to a division: a
    collinear, overlapping pair counts as crossing; anything else parallel
    does not.
