"""Tests for the Scale tool's cursor projection (#57, #47).

`_cursor_world` used to intersect the cursor ray with a plane whose normal
was hardcoded to world-Z. That's wrong in any non-top-down view (#57) and
also wrong for single-axis grips, which should be dragged along their own
axis line rather than snapped to a plane at all (#47).

Fixture note: the plane tests below set `_anchor` but not `_active`, and
`_grips_are_local` defaults to True on a fresh ScaleTool. Since these tools
are never `activate()`d, we set `_grips_are_local = False` so the anchor is
treated as already-world and `_cursor_world` doesn't have to consult
`self._world_transform()` (which depends on `self._model`). This keeps the
plane tests focused purely on the plane-normal bug.
