"""M7.5a Task 13 (#106): the footprint preview and the commit share a plane.

`PrimitiveTool.overlay` used to draw the stage-one rubber band with a
hardcoded world Z=0, while `_commit_footprint` (correctly) resolves the
footprint in the active context's *local* frame. Inside a group translated
in Z, those disagree: the rubber band floats at literal world Z=0 while the
primitive actually lands on the group's own local ground plane (which sits
at a different world Z). This test drives the tool exactly as a user would
-- corners snapped onto the group's own floor, which after a Z translation
report a world Z equal to that translation -- and checks the *rendered*
(world-space) preview against the *rendered* (world-space) commit.

A test that only inspects `_build_ghost_polygons()` or the committed mesh's
local vertex positions cannot fail here: both are already local-frame and
already agree even in the broken code, since `_commit_footprint` was never
the buggy side. Only comparing world-space output -- what `overlay()`
actually hands the renderer versus where the primitive actually ends up in
world space -- exposes the mismatch.
