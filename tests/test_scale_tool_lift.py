"""#60: ScaleTool's local-to-world lift, and defensive append guards.

Brief drift found while implementing (see task-12-brief.md):

- `main_window._tool_manager._tools[...]` doesn't exist. Task 5 re-keyed the
  registry to `_tools_by_id`; the public path is `activate_by_id`. We use
  `main_window._activate("scale")` (which also rebuilds the tool context --
  closer to what actually happens when a user presses S) and then read
  `main_window._tool_manager.active`.
- `main_window._tool_context()` builds a `ToolContext` but does not arm a
  tool (it exists, but arming through it would duplicate what `_activate`
  already does); `_activate` is used throughout instead.
- `test_double_redo_does_not_duplicate_a_group`, as specified in the brief,
  does not reproduce: `CommandStack.redo()` pops one item off its own redo
  stack and is a no-op once that stack is exhausted (see
  `command_stack.py:69-78`), so a second `main_window._command_stack.redo()`
  call never reaches `MakeGroupCommand._redo` a second time in the first
  place -- guarded or not. Further, `_redo` cannot actually be re-entered a
  second time in a row without an intervening `undo()`: its first lines
  unconditionally call `parent_scene.remove_face(f)` on geometry that a
  prior `_redo()` call already removed, which raises `KeyError` from the
  native mesh before the append line is ever reached (verified empirically
  -- see the report). So this specific guard has no reachable duplicate-
  append scenario at all; it is pure belt-and-braces. It is still added
  per the brief's defensive-sweep instruction, but is not given a dedicated
  test here since none can discriminate guarded from unguarded behaviour
  without first hitting an unrelated crash.

  The other two named append sites (`CreateInstanceCommand.do` and
  `DeleteInstanceCommand.undo`) do NOT have this problem -- they never touch
  mesh geometry, so calling `do()`/`undo()` twice in a row (bypassing
  `CommandStack`'s own single-pop protocol, by holding the raw command
  object -- exactly the re-entrancy `Command`'s own docstring in
  `command.py` contracts for) genuinely duplicates the list append pre-fix
  and is idempotent post-fix. Those get direct, discriminating tests below.

- `DeleteInstanceCommand` does not live in `instance_commands.py` as the
  brief states -- it is in `instance_lifecycle_commands.py`, alongside
  `MakeUniqueCommand`. The append-guard fix and its test target that file.
