# lobe as much as it liked and still never move a pixel by more than 10. The
# tests below therefore shade the material and assert on the result.

# render of the same scene (v0.7.2 report, section 4). The shader's own
# structure -- that every uniform exists, is set, and is read -- is already
# pinned by tests/test_two_sided_shading.py, so this transcription cannot
