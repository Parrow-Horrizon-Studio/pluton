"""The sky/ground pass: shader plumbing by source inspection, plus the skip rule.

The fragment shader's horizon arithmetic runs on the GPU and there is nothing
here to call, so most of these tests pin the seams instead: the Python uniform
tuple against the GLSL declarations, and the predicate that decides whether the
pass runs at all.

Fix round 1 adds a render()-level check of the one invariant no source
inspection can see: that the pass actually restores GL_DEPTH_TEST and the
depth mask before returning, and that it runs before the grid. That needs a
recording GL stand-in rather than source inspection, since it is a sequence of
calls, not a piece of text.
