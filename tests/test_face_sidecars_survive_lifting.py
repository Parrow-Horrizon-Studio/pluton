"""Lifting geometry between definitions must carry its face sidecars (#114).

Make Group moves faces from a parent Scene into a fresh child Scene, and
Explode moves them back. Both replay the geometry structurally through
`add_face_from_loop`, which mints a brand new face id in a different Scene, so
nothing carries `_face_materials_*`, `_face_placements_*` or `_face_uvs_*`
across unless something copies them.

This is the third and fourth site in the family: `Scene.split_edge` was fixed
in M7.5c stage 1, and `HalfEdgeMesh::dissolve_edge` is deliberately left alone
(design decision D4a: a merge has two candidate sources per sidecar and no
defensible winner). Unlike dissolve, the mapping here is one to one, so a
verbatim copy is unambiguous.

Every test below paints TWO faces DIFFERENTLY. A fixture that paints one face,
or paints both the same, passes against an implementation that crosses the
mapping, and this milestone has had four separate cases where a fixture's
incidental symmetry hid the distinction the test existed to prove.
