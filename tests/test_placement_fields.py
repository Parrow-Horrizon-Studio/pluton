# _on_after_undo_redo) that MainWindow already uses to keep Entity Info in
# sync with the selection; the placement group now rides along on it rather
# than getting a second, parallel refresh path. These drive the real
# MainWindow selection + refresh machinery (main_window._selection.replace +
# main_window._refresh_selection_status(), the same idiom
# test_entity_info_page.py already uses) instead of calling
# set_placement_target directly, so a broken _refresh_entity_info wiring
# fails here even though the direct-call tests above would not notice it.
