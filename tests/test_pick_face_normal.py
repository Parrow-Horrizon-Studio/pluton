"""#92: face normals under a non-uniform instance scale.

Brief drift found while implementing (see task-13-brief.md): the brief's
example test builds the group via `main_window` + `group_factory` + a UI
`_on_make_group()` call. `pick_face_local` is a pure `Model` method with no
UI dependency (see the existing `tests/test_pick_face_local.py`), so this
test builds the instance directly on a bare `Model` -- no MainWindow/Qt
needed, and it sidesteps the group_factory nesting trap entirely since only
one instance level is involved.
