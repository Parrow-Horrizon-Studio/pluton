    Hidden Line resolves to FLAT_BG: faces are filled with the BACKGROUND
    colour, not with a material colour. A change that reaches glClearColor but
    not resolve_batch_sides passes every other test in this milestone and still
    draws dark grey faces on a white page.

    Note WHICH term carries it: FLAT_BG is an unlit fill, so resolve_face_pass
    puts the background in AMBIENT and zeroes diffuse and specular
    (render_style.py, the FaceShading.FLAT_BG branch). Asserting on diffuse here
    would pass for any background at all, since diffuse is always (0, 0, 0).

    Discriminates: revert the `bg=` argument at the resolve_face_pass call to the
    old _BG_COLOR[:3] and this fails, returning Studio's (0.15, 0.15, 0.18).
