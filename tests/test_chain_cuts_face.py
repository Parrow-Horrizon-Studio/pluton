    happen exactly AT a loop vertex rather than through an edge's interior.
    Each such touch alone is a tangent (an orientation of exactly zero
    against at least one of the two edges meeting there), which a
    crossing-only test cannot tell apart from a vertex the chain safely
    grazes without ever leaving -- only a real sub-interval/containment
    test built on the actual intersection parameters can.

    Built as a small zigzag-boundary loop: it goes up through y=2 at x=2
    (P1, a genuine vertex), peaks, back down through y=2 at x=4.5 (P2),
    dips into a narrow valley, back up through y=2 at x=5.5 (P3), then
    climbs the rest of the way up through y=2 at x=13 (P4) on a long final
    rise. P1 and P4 are the chain's own two endpoints (legitimately on the
    loop). P2 and P3 are two OTHER vertices the straight chain passes
    through in between, exactly at the polygon's boundary, framing a narrow
    exterior sliver (x in roughly (4.5, 5.5)) that the chain's own single
    segment midpoint (at x=7.5, deep in the following wide interior stretch)
    never samples. Mirrors an axis-aligned T-slot floor-plan shape reachable
