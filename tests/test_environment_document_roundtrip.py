"""The load path actually adopts the saved environment, not just accepts it.

A required keyword-only `environment` on _reset_document guarantees a caller
cannot omit the argument. It does not guarantee the callee applies it: a
_reset_document that took `environment` and silently dropped it would satisfy
every signature check and every existing test (none of which reads
win._doc.environment after a reopen), while a Plain White document reopened as
Sky and Ground with no error -- exactly the "file failed to save its
appearance" failure the brief's own rationale for the required keyword warns
about.

Mirrors the save/new/reopen shape of
test_main_window_scenes.test_render_style_persists_through_save_new_open, but
follows self._doc.environment instead of self._render_style.
