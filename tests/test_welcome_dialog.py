    Fix round 1 (review finding): the first version of this test asserted
    `sizeHint().height() >= one_line` and `heightForWidth(min_width) > 0`.
    Neither can fail. Removing setWordWrap(True) drops sizeHint().height() to
    exactly one_line, which still satisfies `>=`. Removing the minimum-width
    call makes heightForWidth(0) wrap to eight-plus lines, which is still
    `> 0`. Both regressions passed the old assertions. This version was
    verified by hand against both mutations (see task-6c-report.md, Fix
    Round 1) rather than trusted by inspection.

    Three independent checks, each with a bound a regression can actually
    cross:

    1. The dialog's minimum width is compared against the production method's
       OWN computation, not read back from the dialog and used as its own
       expectation -- so a removed `setMinimumWidth` call (which leaves
       `minimumWidth()` at Qt's default of 0) is caught directly.
    2. heightForWidth at that minimum width has BOTH a floor and a ceiling:
       readable in full means at most two lines, not merely "more than
       nothing".
    3. Wrapping is proven to actually be happening, not merely available: a
       deliberately narrow width must need strictly MORE height than the
       dialog's minimum width does. Without word wrap, heightForWidth does
       not vary with width at all, so this comparison is what actually
       discriminates that regression.

    The two-line ceiling counts in lineSpacing, not in fontMetrics.height().
    An earlier version of this test used height() and passed locally while
    failing on CI: height() is ascent plus descent, but Qt advances wrapped
    text by lineSpacing, which is height() plus leading. Segoe UI has a
    leading of 0, so the two were indistinguishable on Windows with a real
    platform theme; the offscreen plugin's Sans Serif has a leading of 2, so
    two genuine lines measured 26 against a ceiling of 24. lineSpacing is
    also the bound that holds by construction rather than by luck: n wrapped
    lines occupy n * lineSpacing - leading, so two lines always fit inside
    2 * lineSpacing, and three never do, because lineSpacing exceeds leading
    for any font with a non-zero height.
