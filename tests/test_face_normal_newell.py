"""Scene.face_normal uses Newell's method — and points the SAME WAY as before.

Issue #110. `face_normal` used to estimate the normal from `cross(p1-p0, p2-p0)`
and raise on a loop whose first three vertices are collinear, which is exactly
what an edge split leaves behind. Newell's method over the whole loop fixes it.

The risk in that change is not the fix, it is the SIGN. Six interactive tools
steer by this direction: push/pull extrudes along it, offset decides inward from
outward by it, paint resolves which side was picked with it. A flipped normal
would be a far worse bug than the one being fixed, and would be silent in any
test that only checks the axis. So the central test here is an equivalence
test — on every face the OLD estimate handled correctly, the new result must
agree in direction, not merely lie on the same line.

The old formula is recomputed inline below rather than kept as a preserved copy
of the implementation, so these tests state the property ("Newell agrees with a
first-three cross product wherever that is valid") instead of restating code.
