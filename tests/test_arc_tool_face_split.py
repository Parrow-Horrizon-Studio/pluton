"""ArcTool: drawing an arc across a face divides it (M7.6a task 5, fix round 1).

Mirrors tests/test_line_tool_face_split.py. Before this file, chain_cuts_face
and SplitFaceCommand were wired into ArcTool._commit_polyline with no
automated coverage at all -- every existing test_arc_tool.py case draws into
an empty scene, so the split branch was never entered.

    Every other case in this file is corner to corner. Here both chord
    endpoints land on edge INTERIORS (the midpoints of two opposite sides),
    which is how most arcs get drawn in practice, and the split does not
    happen. The reason: ArcTool has no equivalent of LineTool's
    `_vertex_for_snap`, which is what turns a mid-edge snap into a real loop
    vertex (via SplitEdgeCommand) before the chain is even built. Without
    that step, build_open_polyline drops a free-floating vertex at each
    midpoint that is not part of the quad's boundary loop, so
    chain_cuts_face -- which requires both chain ends to already be loop
    vertices -- finds nothing to split. Do not "fix" ArcTool to match
    LineTool here without reading Finding 3's rationale first: giving a
    second interactive tool a new edge-splitting behaviour at merge time is
    how a new bug ships.
