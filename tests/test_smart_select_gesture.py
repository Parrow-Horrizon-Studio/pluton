"""Smart-select driven as the real gesture, through a real ViewportWidget.

Final review C1. Every test in tests/test_smart_select.py calls SelectTool's
hooks directly and stops there, and every test in
tests/test_viewport_triple_click.py drives presses without ever sending a
release. Between them those two files cover the whole of smart-select except
the one thing the user actually does, which is let go of the mouse button.

Qt's real double-click sequence is Press, Release, DblClick, Release, and
`ViewportWidget.mouseReleaseEvent` dispatches `on_mouse_release` on every
left-button release. So the trailing release ran the ordinary single-click
pick and replaced the selection smart-select had just built. The headline
feature of the milestone was invisible to the user and eleven task-scoped
reviews missed it, because no test ever sent that release.

These tests therefore drive whole gestures -- press, release and all -- into
a MainWindow's own viewport, with its own SelectTool armed through its own
ToolManager. Nothing here reaches past the widget boundary except to read the
resulting Selection.
