"""Generated meshes enter a Scene as ordinary commands (M7.4 Task 10).

`build_mesh_into_scene` is the missing link between Task 9's primitive
generators (which each return a standalone `HalfEdgeMesh`) and Task 11's
tools (which need that mesh living inside an editable, undoable `Scene`).
These tests are written to catch a plausible BROKEN adapter, not just a
completely absent one:

- a count-only assertion would pass against an adapter that welds every
  vertex to the origin, or that winds every face backwards -- so counts are
  always paired with geometry (positions, loop order, edge totals).
- undo is exercised through a real `CommandStack`, from a scene that
  already has geometry in it, so "back to empty" cannot pass by accident
  and a broken adapter that pushes more than one undo step is caught by a
  single `undo()` call not fully reverting.
- the transform test uses translation AND rotation and checks a named
  vertex against its exact expected position, so an adapter that ignores
  `transform` (identity default is easy to accidentally always take) or one
  that applies it row-vector instead of column-vector both fail.
