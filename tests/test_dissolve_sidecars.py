"""Scene.dissolve_edge's agree-or-drop sidecar rule (M7.6a).

Revises M7.5c's D4a ("merges are handled by neither, deliberately"): a
merged face keeps a material, placement, or per-corner UV array only when
BOTH parents carried the identical value, side by side. Disagreement --
including one side painted and the other not, since absence counts as a
value -- drops the sidecar rather than guessing a winner. This is what
makes a split-then-erase round trip lossless when the two halves still
agree, which is the whole reason M7.6a exists.
