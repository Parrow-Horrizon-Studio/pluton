    the depth mask are draw-call state, so a batch blends if EITHER side is
    translucent and both returned passes carry the same flags.

    `tag_color` is Color-by-Tag's override (None when the mode is off). It
    replaces the MATERIAL both sides resolve from, before resolution, rather
    than patching the resolved result afterwards. That distinction is the whole
    behaviour: a post-hoc diffuse patch leaves the material's own ambient (and,
    for a metal, its specular) reaching the shader, so three faces on one tag
    painted three ways still render three different colours, and it overwrites
    the face style's own diffuse decision -- Hidden Line's deliberate flat
    (0, 0, 0) fill included. Substituting the material first routes the tag
    colour through face_uniforms, so every style keeps its own rule: Hidden
    Line stays a flat background fill, Monochrome stays MONO_COLOR, the dim
    pass still dims, and both sides get an ambient and specular derived from
    the tag colour instead of from whatever was painted.

    `translucent_ids` is the same set the buffer partition was built from (see
    _translucent_ids). It is needed here because a CUTOUT texture is
    translucent in a way no other argument can see: the material's own alpha is
    1.0, so resolve_face_pass would leave blending off, the fragment shader's
    sampled alpha would be written into a buffer that ignores it, and the holes
    would come out solid. Required rather than defaulted, matching
    _translucent_ids' own discipline: a caller that omitted it would get solid
    cutouts and no error, which looks exactly like the feature not existing.
    Pass `frozenset()` to mean "nothing here is translucent".

    `bg` is the document environment's background. Hidden Line fills faces with
    it, so it is the colour of the page rather than of any material. Required
    rather than defaulted for the same reason translucent_ids is: a caller that
    omitted it would get the old dark fill with no error, and resolve_face_pass

        Lifted out of the draw loop because pass 1 and pass 2 both need it and
        duplicating it would let the two drift.

        Staleness has two causes, not one. A dirty mesh is the familiar one.
        The other is spec 1.7's asymmetry: uniforms are read from the library
        per batch at draw time, so editing a material's COLOUR shows up with no
        buffer work at all — but the opaque/translucent partition is computed
        here, and editing a material's ALPHA dirties no mesh. Without the set
        comparison a material turned translucent would keep drawing in the
        opaque pass, writing depth and never sorting, which looks like the edit
        did nothing. Comparing the whole set rather than tracking a per-material
        boundary crossing is deliberate: it catches a material being added,
        removed, or edited in either direction, and the set is a handful of ints.

        M7.5b adds a third cause of the same shape: the per-corner UVs are baked
        into the vertex buffer from each material's texture_size, which also
        lives on the library, so resizing a texture dirties no mesh and would
        otherwise go on tiling at the old size.

        M7.7 adds a fourth cause of the same shape: the edge colour is baked
        into the edge vertex buffer from the document's environment, which no
        mesh dirty flag covers either, so switching environment would otherwise
        leave every definition drawing its old ink.
