"""Shared vocabulary for the snap & inference engine.

`snap_engine.py` (the selection policy) and `snap_candidates.py` (the pure
geometry generators) both need `SnapKind` and `Candidate`, and neither may
import the other without creating a cycle. This module exists so they can
share that vocabulary without importing each other: it deliberately depends
on nothing else in `pluton.viewport`.

`AcquiredKind` and `Acquired` live here too, for the same reason: Task 4's
candidate generators in `snap_candidates.py` need `AcquiredKind` without
importing `inference.py` (which is stateful and depends on this module).
`inference.py` imports both from here and re-exports them. This module must
keep depending on nothing but numpy and the standard library.
