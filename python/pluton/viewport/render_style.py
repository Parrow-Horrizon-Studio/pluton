#
# A dielectric's specular is pinned at _DIELECTRIC_F0, i.e. 10/255, so 10/255
# was the hard ceiling on how far roughness could move any pixel no matter
# what the highlight lobe did -- and a measured sweep hit exactly that
# ceiling. Roughness therefore has to move a term that is not the highlight.
# It moves the one a real renderer's environment term would move: a rough
# surface scatters incoming light in every direction, so it reads flat and
# evenly lit (more ambient, less directional), and a smooth one reads
# contrasty (less ambient, more directional).
#
# Both scales are 1.0 at roughness 0.5 BY CONSTRUCTION, so the default
# dielectric that every unpainted back face and most painted faces use keeps
# exactly its v0.7.1 ambient and diffuse.

# Equal gains are what makes the signed mean vanish: the balance point is
# _AMBIENT_FACTOR * _ROUGH_AMBIENT_GAIN / _ROUGH_DIFFUSE_GAIN == 0.55, and
# 0.55 is very close to the mean dot(N, -L) over a lit solid's visible face
# pixels, so what one term gives up the other takes back. The slider then
# redistributes rather than dimming: over the same sweep the darkest quartile
# of face pixels rises 31.7/255 and the brightest quartile falls 24.9/255.
# Magnitude 1.0 was preferred over 1.2 because it is already a 7x improvement

    An approximation, not real PBR: M12's renderer will not match it pixel for
    pixel. What it buys is that every editable field changes what you see.

    Three of those four lines changed in M7.5b (#107), and all three changes
    are departures from real PBR made deliberately because this renderer has
    one directional light and no environment term:

    * ambient no longer carries a (1 - metallic) factor. In real PBR a metal
      has no diffuse lobe and its appearance comes entirely from what it
      reflects; with nothing to reflect, metallic 1.0 rendered pure black off
      the highlight. A metal's colour IS its reflectance, and ambient is the
      only stand-in for environment light here, so the metal keeps it: a red
      metal now reads dark red. Dielectrics are untouched, since the dropped
      factor was 1.0 at metallic 0.
    * roughness drives the ambient/diffuse balance (see the gain constants).
    * shininess uses 256 ** (1 - roughness) instead of the spec's stated
      Blinn-Phong equivalence 2 / roughness**4 - 2. That equivalence clamped
      to _MAX_SHININESS for every roughness below 0.28, so the first third of
      the slider did nothing; it is derived for a renderer that has an
      environment term to carry the rest of the response, which this one does
      not.
