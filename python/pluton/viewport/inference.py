"""Acquisition and inference locking: the stateful half of the snap path.

`SnapEngine` is stateless by design. Hover-dwell acquisition needs a clock and
locking needs memory across frames, so both live here, behind an injected
`now_ms` so dwell is a value in tests and never a wall-clock timer.

`ViewportWidget._snap_for_event` is the single choke point every tool already
flows through, so wiring this in there leaves all twenty tools untouched: they
keep receiving exactly one `SnapResult`.

`AcquiredKind` and `Acquired` are defined in `snap_types.py`, not here, and
re-exported below: Task 4's candidate generators in `snap_candidates.py` need
`AcquiredKind` and must never import this (stateful) module.
