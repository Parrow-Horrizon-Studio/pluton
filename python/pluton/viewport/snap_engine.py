"""Snap & inference engine: the selection policy over the candidate generators.

Gathers candidates for every `SnapKind` in tolerance (the generators live in
`snap_candidates.py`) and picks one. Precedence is D12's explicit table,
`_PRECEDENCE` below, NOT the numeric value of `SnapKind`: the two were
decoupled in M7.6b so kinds could be added to the enum without renumbering
the ordering. Ties inside one kind break on screen distance, then depth.

Stateless by design (D1). Acquisition (hover-dwell) and inference locking are
stateful and live in `inference.py`, which wraps this.
