"""One face's texture coordinates, resolved in loop order.

Spec decision D9 requires the renderer and the exporter to agree about what a
face's UVs are. They cannot share one function: the renderer needs per triangle
corner, vectorised across a whole definition on every buffer upload, and calling
a per-face routine there made M7.5b's upload 15.7 times slower. So this module
is the per-face REFERENCE implementation, and tests/test_uv_resolve.py pins the
renderer's batched path to it corner for corner. Change one and you must change
the other, exactly as uv_projection.py's scalar and batched siblings already
work.
