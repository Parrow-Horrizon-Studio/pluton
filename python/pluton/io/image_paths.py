"""Resolving an image file referenced by a document, safely.

Both OBJ's `map_Kd` and glTF's `image.uri` name a file relative to the
document. A document someone emailed you must not be able to name a file
outside its own directory: the bytes it points at are read into the model and
then saved, shared and exported with it, so a traversal here is a read
primitive for anything the user can open.

This module also holds `sanitize_filename_stem`, the write-side counterpart:
a material or texture name that becomes part of an exported filename is just
as untrusted, since on import a texture is named after the source document's
own material name (see gltf_import._find_or_decode_texture).

# unsafe for narrower reasons: 'a:b' names an NTFS alternate data stream, and
# '#', '?', '%' are significant in a URI and glTF's `image.uri` requires them
# percent-encoded, so passing them through unescaped writes a spec-invalid

# names this file), and read_gltf_scene already guards the document itself
# and every declared element count precisely so nothing downstream reads an
# unbounded amount of attacker-controlled data. A texture sitting beside a
# small, otherwise-innocuous .gltf/.obj is exactly the shape that guard would
