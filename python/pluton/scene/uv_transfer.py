"""Carry a face's stored per-corner UVs across an edge split or a face split.

Pure arithmetic over loops, coordinates and triangulations, with no Scene and
no kernel, so these functions are testable in isolation and cheap to reason
about. `uv_at_point_in_face` uses numpy for the coordinate math; nothing here
touches the mesh.
