"""Application colour scheme (M7.7).

Light and Dark only, with Light the default. No System option: SketchUp is
light on every OS regardless of the system setting, so light-unless-asked is
the faithful behaviour, and a third state would triple what the palette-refresh
path has to be tested against for nothing a user can see. It stays trivially
addable later, because Qt.ColorScheme.Unknown already means follow-the-system.

Qt is 6.11, so QStyleHints.setColorScheme is available directly and no custom
stylesheet is needed: the icons already recolour themselves from the palette
(see pluton.ui.icons), they simply never refreshed when it changed (#101).
