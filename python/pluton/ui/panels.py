"""The Properties editor's tab table (M7.3).

Qt-free, like actions.py, and carrying the same "importing this loads no
PySide6" test.

Be clear-eyed about what this buys. Unlike actions.py -- where one declaration
feeds a menu, a toolbar, a shortcut and a context menu -- a tab appears in
exactly ONE surface, so this table collapses no duplication. It exists for a
narrower reason: it makes "every tab id maps to an icon asset that exists" a
test rather than a blank button someone notices in a screenshot. M7.2 hit that
class of bug, which is why ui_builder.build_action carries a KeyError fallback.

Page construction stays in properties_dock.py: a factory here would need Qt
and defeat the point.
