"""Per-user application preferences (M7.7).

The second non-document state in the application, after window_state.py, and
deliberately a separate module from it: that one owns geometry and toolbar
layout and carries its own WINDOW_STATE_VERSION which Qt validates and rejects
on mismatch. A theme choice has no business bumping that version.

Every function takes the QSettings object as a parameter rather than
constructing one, for the reason window_state.py gives: on Windows a
default-constructed QSettings writes the real registry, so tests inject a
temporary IniFormat store and the suite touches no real user state.

No read raises. A corrupt or absent value returns the documented default,
because these are read during startup and a bad settings store must not be able
to stop the application from opening.
