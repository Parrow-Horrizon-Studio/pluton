"""Window geometry and toolbar-layout persistence (M7.2).

Pluton's first non-document state. Everything else the application remembers
lives inside the .pluton file; this is per-user, per-machine preference.

Every function takes the QSettings object as a parameter rather than
constructing one. On Windows a default-constructed QSettings writes to the
real registry, so tests inject a temporary IniFormat store and the suite
touches no real user state.

Restore never raises. A corrupt or stale blob returns False and the caller
keeps Qt's default layout -- a bad settings store must not be able to stop
the application from starting.
