"""Per-tool cursors (M7.2).

Cursors are *derived from* the icon set rather than drawn as separate art:
the tool's own glyph is composited into the lower-right of a shared base, so
redrawing an icon updates its cursor automatically and the two cannot drift.

Two bases, matching the semantics of the tools:
  CROSSHAIR - the tool places a point; the hotspot is the crosshair centre.
  ARROW     - the tool picks an existing entity, where a crosshair would
              imply an accuracy that is not being used.

The badge glyph is haloed in white before its black ink is painted on top --
the same technique the crosshair and arrow bases already use, and for the
same reason: Pluton's viewport clears to a near-black
`(0.15, 0.15, 0.18)`, so a bare black glyph would disappear into it. The
halo is built from the glyph's own strokes offset by one device-independent
pixel in each of the eight directions, not a filled backdrop panel -- our
icon set is thin single-stroke outlines, not filled shapes, and a panel was
tried and rejected in favour of this lighter-weight look.

`compose_cursor` takes a `dpr` (a QScreen.devicePixelRatio()) so the cursor
stays crisp on a HiDPI display: the pixmap is rendered at `dpr` physical
pixels per logical pixel and carries that ratio as
`QPixmap.devicePixelRatio()`. Painting is done in the fixed, device-
independent CURSOR_SIZE/BADGE_SIZE coordinate space -- Qt's paint engine
scales every drawing operation against the target pixmap's devicePixelRatio,
so the same paint code produces a sharp result at any ratio. The hotspot
constants are likewise device-independent and never scaled by `dpr` in this
module: Qt re-scales them against the pixmap's own devicePixelRatio when it
binds the platform cursor, exactly as it does for the pixmap content.
