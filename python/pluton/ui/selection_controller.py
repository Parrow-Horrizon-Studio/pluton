"""Selection operations, lifted out of MainWindow (M7.3 Task 1).

Every function here takes its collaborators explicitly and imports no Qt, so
the selection rules are testable without a QApplication. MainWindow keeps the
Qt half -- status bar text, viewport repaint, dock indicators -- and delegates
the decisions here.

assign_tag returns (did_assign, message) rather than touching a status bar,
so the same call serves the Tags panel button and the right-click Assign Tag
submenu without either one owning the other's UI.
