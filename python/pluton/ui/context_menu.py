"""Right-click menu composition (M7.2).

context_menu_ids and is_enabled are pure: given what is under the cursor and
a little model state, they say what the menu contains and which entries are
live. Task 14 (resolve_context_target / build_context_menu below) turns that
into a hit-test and a QMenu.

Entries are disabled rather than hidden when they do not apply. A menu whose
items keep their position is learnable; one that reflows between right-clicks
is not.

build_context_menu reuses the menu bar's own QAction objects (see
ui_builder.ACTION_REGISTRY_ATTR), so it mutates their shared enabled state.
MainWindow._on_context_menu_requested is responsible for unconditionally
re-enabling every action once the menu closes -- see the comment there for
why that must not be conditional.
