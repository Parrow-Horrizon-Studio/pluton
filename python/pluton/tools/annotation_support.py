"""Shared helpers for the M7d annotation tools (Dimension, and Text in M7d T9).

Both tools snap points in WORLD space -- the renderer draws
`ToolOverlay.rubber_band_segments` in world space with no model matrix
applied, so a tool's live preview must be built from world coordinates -- but
the annotations they create (`pluton.model.annotation.Dimension` / `Label`)
store CONTEXT-LOCAL coordinates, so they ride along correctly when their
group/component moves. `world_to_active_local` is the single conversion point
both tools call when committing a click to storage, so the two tools cannot
drift out of sync on how that world-to-local conversion is done.
