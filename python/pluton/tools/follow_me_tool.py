"""The Follow Me tool -- SketchUp-style profile sweep along a path.

Unlike Push/Pull and Offset, the path is chosen BEFORE this tool is armed:
Select preselects a chain of edges, the tool is armed (no shortcut -- M7.4
Task 5's id-keyed registry is what makes that legal), and the single click
that follows names the profile face. Preselecting the path first is what
makes the gesture unambiguous, and matches SketchUp's own Follow Me.

Path ordering is this tool's own job (`_order_path`): the selection arrives
as an unordered set of edge ids, which has to be walked into a chain before
`sweep_stations` (M7.4 Task 7) can do anything with it. A selection that
does not form a single unbranched chain -- a fork, or two disjoint runs --
is refused with a status-bar message, the same way `sweep_stations` refuses
a corner too tight for the profile (`SweepRefused`): both are reported, not
raised past this tool, and neither mutates the scene.
