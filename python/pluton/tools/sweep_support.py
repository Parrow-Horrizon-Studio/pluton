def sweep_stations(
    profile_loop: np.ndarray, path_points: np.ndarray, *, closed: bool
) -> list[np.ndarray]:
    """Build one 4x4 world-from-profile transform per path vertex.

    Convention: column-vector, right-multiplied, matching
    `geometry/transforms.py`'s `apply_mat` (`p_world = M @ [p_local; 1]`).
    `p_local` is `profile_loop` in the caller's own coordinates -- there is
    no separate "local space" to move into first; each returned matrix maps
    the profile's own points directly to their position at that station.

    RELATIVE-FRAME CONTRACT. Station `i` is
    `Station_i @ Station_0_unmitered^-1`, where `Station_i` is the absolute
    frame built at `path_points[i]` below and `Station_0_unmitered` is the
    frame at `path_points[0]` oriented by segment 0 alone (never mitered,
    even when the path closes). Every returned matrix therefore maps
    `path_points[0]` -> `path_points[i]`: the frame's origin is the path's
    OWN start, not the profile's centroid. A profile drawn off to one side
    of the path keeps that offset all the way along, which is exactly what
    makes a lathe rather than a tube (spec 1.6). An earlier revision mapped
    the profile centroid onto every path point, which silently recentred
    every offset profile onto the path axis and made a lathe unreachable.

    Two consequences a caller must handle:

    * Open path: station 0 IS `Station_0_unmitered`, so `stations[0]` is
      the identity. The profile as drawn is already the first
      cross-section, and a caller may skip station 0 and loft the source
      loop straight to station 1.
    * Closed path: station 0 is the seam miter and is NOT the identity. It
      must be applied. The ring sequence is
      `M_0(profile) -> M_1 -> ... -> M_{n-1} -> back to M_0(profile)`;
      terminating the closing segment on the raw profile instead lands it
      on a cross-section that does not lie on the seam's miter plane.

    The relative composition is exact for the canonical Follow Me setup --
    a profile whose plane is perpendicular to segment 0 and contains
    `path_points[0]`. A profile plane tilted relative to segment 0, or one
    that `path_points[0]` does not lie in, additionally shifts every
    cross-section a constant distance along its own station normal; that is
    inherent to expressing placements relative to a single starting frame
    and is not corrected here.

    At an interior vertex (or every vertex of a closed path) the plane
    normal is the unit bisector of the incoming and outgoing directions --
    the classic miter plane, tilted equally into both segments (Task 8
    lofts consecutive stations with straight quads; a tilted-but-shared
    plane is what makes that loft meet without a gap at the corner). At an
    open path's two endpoints there is only one adjoining segment, so the
    normal is just that segment's direction.

    A rigid copy of the profile rotated onto the miter plane would not
    actually close the gap: the incoming and outgoing straight extrusions
    only agree at a corner if each profile vertex is slid along ITS OWN
    segment direction until it lands on the shared miter plane (the same
    construction as a mitered picture-frame corner, generalized to an
    arbitrary profile). This module computes that per-vertex slide from
    both sides and averages them, since a general (non-symmetric) profile
    has no exact common answer.

    Raises `SweepRefused` if the corner is too tight for the profile: see
    `_mitered_station` for the exact criterion and why it is geometric
    rather than a tuned constant.

    Known limitation (Task 7 review): each station's frame is built FRESH
    from the source profile's own normal, not transported sequentially from
    the previous station, so there is no torsion-minimising frame across a
    path with several non-coplanar corners in a row -- the swept profile can
    accumulate more visual twist along such a path than a transported frame
    would. This is out of scope for what Follow Me (Task 8) is specified to
    do; a future caller chasing minimal-twist sweeps needs to know it isn't
    here.

    `u_axis`, `v_axis`, `normal` are an orthonormal triad, so this rank-3
    reconstruction (`M_linear = outer(u_image,u_axis) + outer(v_image,v_axis)
    + outer(n_image,normal)`) is exact: it is the unique linear map with
    the three requested images, and every profile point decomposes cleanly
    into that triad since `centroid`-relative offsets are, by construction
    (`normal` comes from the profile's own cross-sum), perpendicular to
    `normal`.

    The construction, per vertex offset `o` (relative to `centroid`):

    1. Rotate `o` into each segment's own straight-extrusion frame:
       `o_in = R(normal -> d_in) @ o`, and likewise `o_out` for `d_out`.
       This is what a plain (unmitered) straight sweep would place at this
       station from that side alone -- `o_in`/`o_out` are exactly
       perpendicular to `d_in`/`d_out`.
    2. Slide each along its own segment direction until it lands on the
       shared miter plane (through `position`, normal = the unit bisector
       `t` of `d_in` and `d_out`): `o_in - ((o_in . t) / (d_in . t)) * d_in`,
       and likewise for `o_out`. This is a line/plane intersection, solved
       once per vertex since each vertex's line is fixed but its offset
       from the plane differs.
    3. Average the two. They agree exactly only for a profile symmetric
       about the corner's bisector plane; averaging is the natural
       (rotation-and-reflection-symmetric, order-independent) choice for
       the general case, and both feed into a linear combination that
       reduces to a plain rotation whenever `d_in == d_out` (a "corner"
       that isn't one) or the profile is centred and symmetric.

    Refusal criterion: step 2's slide distance for a profile vertex,
    measured from `position` back along `d_in` (or forward along `d_out`),
    is unbounded as the turn approaches 180 degrees -- there is no tuned
    threshold for "too far". What IS a hard geometric fact is that a slide
    longer than the segment itself reaches past the OTHER end of that
    segment, i.e. past a neighbouring station that already exists; the
    corner has then consumed geometry that belongs to the next joint over,
    which is exactly the profile folding onto itself. So the refusal test
    is: does any profile vertex's slide distance, on either side, exceed
    that side's own segment length. `len_in`/`len_out` come from the path
    itself, not a constant.
