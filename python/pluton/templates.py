"""Document templates: a units configuration paired with an environment.

Pure data, no Qt, so the table is testable without a QApplication and the
welcome dialog stays a thin view over it.

Templates differ in UNITS CONFIGURATION, not only in environment, which is what
keeps the concept from being a second name for the preset table. Units already
carries metric_precision and imperial_denominator, and those are exactly what
SketchUp's templates vary: its architectural templates round to whole
millimetres, its woodworking templates work in sixteenths of an inch.

No template sets the camera (spec D6). That is why the white one is called
Documentation rather than Plan View, which would promise a top-down view it
never applies.
