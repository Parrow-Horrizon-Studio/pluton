"""Pure selection derivations: the neighbour queries behind smart-select, the
connected-component flood behind triple-click, and the set operations behind
Edit > Invert and the right-click Select submenu.

Every function takes ids plus a Scene (or, where tags are involved, a Model)
and returns ids. Nothing here imports Qt, mutates a Selection, or knows that
menus exist, so each function is directly callable in a test with no widget
and no QApplication.

That is deliberate rather than stylistic. M7.6b measured that tests routed
through the widget masked defects which direct calls on the pure generators
caught, and the same milestone shipped one constant in three copies because
two callers each grew their own. Triple-click and `grow` share a walk here
for the same reason: one copy cannot drift.

A dead id is skipped rather than raised on, matching how
`transform_support.selection_vertices` already tolerates a stale id. A
selection can outlive the geometry it names, briefly, between a command and
the `prune_to_live` that follows it.
